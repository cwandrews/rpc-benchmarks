Benchmarking different ways to use go's 'net/rpc' pagage

Inspired by a talk by Albert Strasheim given at [GoSF](http://www.meetup.com/golangsf/), this is meant to go a bit further in implementing similar tests but doing serialization for the round trip of an RPC call using go's ["net/rpc"](http://golang.org/pkg/net/rpc/). Albert's original benchmarks can be foud [here](https://github.com/cloudflare/goser). After this code is written, I will do a write-up about my findings and post some pretty graphs or something.
